# AntTheNotAIBot
A silly bot for discord, I don't even think its gonna work anytime soon.

# Description
It started all with a joke to create a bot in the discord channel. The purpose it to remind classmates to be show up for the zoom meeting for lecture.

## Timer
It sends out reminder 10 mins before class starts.

### It checks hours, mins, and secs.
* If it is not the scheduled hour or mins, it wait depends on diff in time.
* If it is already passed, it's going to wait until the end of day...

## Word mathcing responses:
* oh no ==> Oh YES
* hell yeah / hell yes ==> OH HELL NO

## Functions to call:
* !ravioli ==> *just go find out yourself* :P
